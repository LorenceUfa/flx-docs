System Architecture
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
OpxFlexSwitch is built with the following design principles
    - Model driven architecture, Each protcol/component has well defined model. 
    - Micro service architecture, Each protocols/component can function independently
    - Flexible and Modular architecture
    - All protocol daemons are optional
    - All Infrastructure components can be replaced with another similar component

Open Source Components
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
OpxFlexSwitch, being an opensource soultion, relies on several other opensource components.
These OpenSource components are of great help in simplifying our implementation. 
We acknowledge and are grateful to these developers for their contributions to open source.
